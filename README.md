# wwlln
Test program for the WWLLN website with Aaron Bach's aiowwlln library.

Uses python3 to access the wwlln website data, filtering by radius and time window.  The program captures data within the range, than prints out the most recent strike, and the closest.

Worth playing with if you are trying out the Home Assistant component.
